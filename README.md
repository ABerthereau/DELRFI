# DELRFI
Deep Learning RFI mitigation code.
This repository contains the deep learning method used in the paper [paper name](paperlink) and the trained weights.

The network architecture is a U-net using the mobileNetV2 as features extractor. The data used for trains, validations and tests are pulsar observations from the Nan√ßay radio telescope in France.
